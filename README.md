# Visualisation-in-Data-Science
Repository for Visualisation in Data Science

Problem Statement
The year is 2016, and you have been hired by the coach of an up-and-coming European football club (pick a team!) to analyze data they have collected from the web. This analysis will help shape the club’s strategy for the next season, including:
- Identifying promising young players worth signing.
- Tracking team improvements over recent years to assess progress.
- Understanding the club’s strongest and weakest opponents based on historical performance.
To convince the club president to support player acquisitions, the coach requires insightful and visually compelling data visualizations that answer these key questions:

* Who are the promising young players to book for next year?
* Which teams have improved the most in recent seasons?
* Which teams has our club performed best and worst against over time?
This project delivers powerful insights using data analysis & visualization techniques, supporting strategic football decisions.


Step 1: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended). You’ll need the following libraries:
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib for visualizations
- seaborn for advanced plotting
- numpy for numerical operations

Step 2: Prepare the Dataset
Make sure you have the Match.csv, Team.csv, Player.csv, and Player_Attributes.csv files.
- Place them inside the data/ folder in your project directory.


Step 3: Run the Main Script
This will: 
- Load datasets
- Process team and player statistics
- Generate football performance insights
- Save visualization


Step 4: View the Output
Once the script runs successfully:
- Go to the output/ folder to view generated plots.
- If any errors occur, check the dataset paths or dependencies.
